## Image Captioning using VGG16 and LSTM

### Introduction

Image captions using deep learning techniques with VGG16 for feature extraction and LSTM for sequence generation. The model is trained on the Flickr8K dataset, where images are paired with descriptive captions. This project demonstrates how to preprocess images, build a deep learning model, and evaluate its performance using BLEU scores.
